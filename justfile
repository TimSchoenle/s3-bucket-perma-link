# Everything a contributor has to run by hand lives here rather than in a script under

# developer types are one string. Recipes that only wrap `cargo` are here for the same reason:
# the flags are the part people get wrong.

# There is deliberately no recipe that *checks* the generated artefacts. Checking is
# `TimSchoenle/actions/actions/rust/config-contract`, which does it in three places this file
# cannot reach — against the Dockerfile, against the committed document, and against the labels a
# built image actually carries. A second implementation here would be a second opinion, and the
# whole point of the shared action is that there is only one.

# The generator, and where its output belongs. These five lines are the only per-repository part
