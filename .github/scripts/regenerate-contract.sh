# A writer, not a checker. The checking half is the `rust/config-contract` action, which does it
# in three places this script never reached — against the Dockerfile, against the committed
# document, and against the labels a *built image* actually carries.
#
# Run it yourself before pushing, or let `docs.yml` run it on the pull request and commit the
# result: a pull request that renames a key or changes the loader's prefix then arrives with the
# document for it already written, in the commit that caused it.
#
# `--format contract` is generated without `--version`, `--revision` or `--created`, so it is
# byte-reproducible across rebuilds and releases: the committed copy describes the configuration
# surface, and the copy in an image additionally names the build it came from.
